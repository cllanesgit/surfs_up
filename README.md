# Overview
In this analysis we look into the temperatures for the month of June and December to judge whether the client's business would remain relevant throughout the whole year. This judges the temperatures for the first and second half of the year. Tables were provided to visualize and provide important data requested. This is done by using multiple queries, create dataframes, as well as using the .describe() method to provide essential data. 

# Results
* In June we see a mean temperature of aprox. 75 degrees with a max of 85 which are good temperatures for what the business needs. However, the minimum is 64 which is not exactly deemed to be a hot enough temperature for surfing or ice cream consumption. This may have some days have less clientele than others depending on certain circumstances.

#Summary

This data should provide a good idea as to what the temperatures will be for both months, half-way and at the end of the year. However, extra data could be pulled in new queries in regards to the months of January and February which tend to be cold, if not colder than December, to make sure that the business stays relevant through that period. Regardless, data shows that is has a strong base to succeed under the provided temperatures.
